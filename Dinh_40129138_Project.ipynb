        "   This project report presents the development of a personalized recommendation system for Twitch live-stream viewers using machine learning techniques. The system is built on a dataset of Twitch user interactions collected by the University of California San Diego[\\[1\\]](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#twitch) over 43 days, including user and streamer IDs, start and stop times, and streamer usernames. The objective is to provide users with personalized recommendations based on their viewing history, thereby increasing engagement and retention on the platform. \n",
        "   \n",
        "   The system employs collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques to make accurate predictions about users' preferences and recommend relevant streamers that are currently available and live-streaming. The results indicate that the proposed recommendation engine performs better than traditional approaches, achieving an accuracy of 85% in predicting user preferences. The system has the potential to enhance user experience and promote platform growth by retaining users for longer periods and introducing them to new content creators.\n"
